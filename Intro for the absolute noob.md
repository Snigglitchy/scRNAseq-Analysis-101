You’re new to R? 
You don’t know where to start from? 
Feeling overwhelmed? Worse, feeling scared? 
Don't let a programming language scare you, my fellow Bioscientist friend.

I have been there, so I know how you’re feeling. 

Don’t worry. I gotcha. 

Trust the process and trust yourself. 

This, is the ULTIMATE MOST EPIC-EST GUIDE FOR AN ABSOLUTE NOOB. 
Stick around and you’ll learn something, if not everything.
